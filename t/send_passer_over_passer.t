## The point of this somewhat esoteric test is to verify that you can
## send passer sockets (AF_UNIX sockets) themselves over a passer object.

## To do this, we setup a passer object between a parent and child,
## create a socketpair in the parent, and then send this socket to the
## child over the passer object. The parent and children both use their
## respective ends of the socketpair to instantiate another passer object
## over which a pipe is sent.
